# DeepLearning_CNN with Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras

As a beginer in Deep Learning and CNN , I tried to use the Google Colab to experiment with few of the ideas .
I have started with a simple CNN model ,then progressed to transfer learning with VGG net, then moved on to 
building a resnet50 network from scratch(using TF2.0 & keras API), implemented the mobilenet version 1. Hope 
this could help a beginer in CNN and motivate him/her to experiment with various CNN architectures.

Thanks for reading
